    <h1>Real Estate Investing</h1>
    <p>
      I have recently started investing in properties in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas.
      <br />
      Previously I only invested in homes in New Jersey particularly Bergen County, Essex County, Passaic County and
      Middlesex County.
    </p>
    <p>Soon I will provide me information about real estate investments here.</p>
